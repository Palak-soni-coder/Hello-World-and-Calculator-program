## Overview

This repository contains a collection of basic C++ programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. Each program is designed to build a strong foundation in C++ by exploring key elements like input/output operations, data types, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.

## 1. Hello, World! Program

This is the classic starting point for learning any programming language. The "Hello, World!" program demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ application, including:

- Use of `#include <iostream>` for input/output operations.
- The `main()` function as the entry point.
- Use of `cout` to display output on the console.

**Purpose:**  
To understand how to print text and get familiar with the syntax and structure of a simple C++ program.

## 2. Simple Calculator

This program acts as a basic command-line calculator that performs the four fundamental arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

**Functionality:**  
- Takes two floating-point numbers as input from the user using `cin`.
- Performs each arithmetic operation and stores the results in variables.
- Displays the output clearly with appropriate labels.

**Objective:**  
To practice user input handling, variable declaration, data types (especially `float`), and basic arithmetic operations.

## 3. Average Marks and Grade Calculator

This program accepts marks for 5 subjects and calculates the average, then assigns a grade based on that average.

**Core Concepts Demonstrated:**
- Integer inputs and calculations.
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) for decision-making.
- Logical operators for grade ranges.

**Purpose:**  
To learn how to implement real-world grading logic using conditional branching in C++.

## 4. Number Type Checker

This program checks whether a given number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**.

**Key Learnings:**
- Use of `if-else` conditions.
- Understanding and comparing integer values.

**Use Case:**  
Simple logic-building using basic conditional structures.

## 5. Coordinate Plane Quadrant Identifier

This program takes `x` and `y` coordinates and determines where the point lies:

- 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th Quadrant
- X-axis, Y-axis
- Origin

**Concepts Covered:**
- Nested conditionals.
- Logical AND (`&&`) operators.
- Multiple condition checks and exhaustive branching.

**Why it's useful:**  
Great practice for problem-solving and real-life geometry-based applications in C++.

## Operators in C++

Operators are the core of most logical and mathematical operations in C++. Here's a quick explanation of the types used across these programs:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
  Used for basic calculations like addition and multiplication.

- **Relational Operators**: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`  
  Used in conditions to compare values.

- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`  
  Combine multiple conditions logically.

- **Assignment Operator**: `=`  
  Used to assign values to variables.

Each operator plays a crucial role in writing conditions, loops, and expressions â€” which are the building blocks of any C++ program.

## Final Thoughts

These programs form the backbone of learning C++. They not only teach the syntax but also the logic-building necessary for more complex programming tasks. As a beginner, mastering these will make it easier to tackle topics like loops, arrays, functions, and object-oriented programming in future modules.
