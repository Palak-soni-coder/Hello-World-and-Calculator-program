C++ Foundational Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic C++ programs designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and syntax. The projects serve as an introduction to C++ development.

1. "Hello, World!" Program
This program is a standard implementation of the "Hello, World!" exercise. Its primary purpose is to illustrate the essential structure of a C++ application, including the use of the iostream library for standard output operations and the declaration of the main function as the program's entry point. The application outputs a static string to the console.

2. Simple Calculator Application
This program is an elementary command-line calculator that executes basic arithmetic operations. It is designed to demonstrate handling of user input via the standard input stream (cin) and the use of variables to store and manipulate data.

Functional Specification:
Input: The program prompts the user to provide two numerical inputs. These are handled as float data types to accommodate floating-point numbers.

Processing: It performs four standard arithmetic calculations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on the provided inputs.

Output: The application displays the result of each of the four operations to the console, with each result clearly labeled.
